How I Used SonarQube to Analyze DVWA: A Beginner-Friendly Walkthrough

When I started this project, I wanted real experience with a tool that professionals actually use to find security flaws in applications. Instead of just reading about vulnerabilities, I wanted to see them — what they look like inside code, how they’re detected, and how the scanning process works.

To do that, I used two well-known tools:

DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) — intentionally insecure for learning

SonarQube — a static analysis platform used to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code quality issues

Project Goal:
Scan DVWA using SonarQube, analyze the results, and understand how real-world security scanning works.

This walkthrough explains step-by-step how I set everything up, what SonarQube found, the mistakes I made, and what I learned.

Setting Up DVWA and SonarQube Using Docker

Using Docker made it easy to run everything in isolated environments. Even though this setup seems simple, it taught me the most about managing security tools.

Starting DVWA

DVWA is designed for practicing cybersecurity concepts. After pulling the DVWA Docker image, I launched the container and accessed the vulnerable web application in my browser.
It provided a safe environment full of intentional vulnerabilities, which was perfect for learning.

Starting SonarQube in Docker

SonarQube required more resources, and its Docker image took a long time to download. At first, I thought something was broken, but eventually it finished and I accessed the SonarQube dashboard.

Seeing the dashboard load was a milestone because SonarQube is commonly used in real DevSecOps pipelines.

Running the SonarScanner

Once both containers were running, the next step was scanning the DVWA code using SonarScanner, a tool that sends source code to SonarQube for analysis.

This part taught me how SonarQube organizes projects, tokens, and scan configurations.

Creating a SonarQube Project

My first scanning attempts failed because SonarQube requires a project to exist before uploads.

Here’s what I did:

Logged into the SonarQube dashboard

Clicked Create Project

Named the project (example: dvwa-analysis)

Generated an authentication token

The token allows SonarScanner to authenticate securely.

Running the Scan

After setting up everything correctly, I ran the scanner command again. This time SonarScanner:

Collected DVWA source code

Applied security and code quality rules

Uploaded findings to the dashboard

Seeing a successful scan run helped me understand how all the pieces connect.

What SonarQube Found in DVWA

Once the scan completed, the SonarQube dashboard showed a list of issues.

Highlighted Finding: JavaScript Variable Used Without Declaration

SonarQube flagged the variable day, which was used without let, const, or var.

Why This Matters

JavaScript creates unintended global variables

Globals can be overwritten by other scripts

They cause unpredictable behavior

They make debugging harder

In larger applications, small issues like this can lead to bigger maintainability and security problems.

SonarQube also grouped findings into:

Security Hotspots

Code Smells

Bugs

This helped me see the difference between maintainability issues and security vulnerabilities.

Challenges I Faced (And What They Taught Me)

This project wasn’t perfect. I ran into several challenges, and each one pushed me to understand the tools better.

1. Extremely Slow SonarQube Download

The Docker image was huge, and I thought the installation was failing.

What I learned:
Large enterprise tools take time. Slow downloads do not always mean errors.

2. Scanner Failed Repeatedly

My early scans kept failing until I realized I needed to create a project in SonarQube first.

What I learned:
Understanding the required workflow is important — tools expect certain steps in a certain order.

3. Confusion About Authentication Tokens

I had to learn how tokens authenticate the scanner and allow secure uploads.

What I learned:
Tokens are used everywhere in development and security. Understanding how they work is essential.

What I Learned

This project helped me understand how cybersecurity and development overlap.

✔ Static analysis is powerful

SonarQube revealed issues I wouldn’t notice manually.

✔ Small coding mistakes matter

The undeclared day variable showed how tiny errors become larger problems.

✔ Troubleshooting is part of the process

Most tools don’t work perfectly on the first try — and that’s normal.

✔ Professional tools require proper setup

Once SonarQube is correctly configured, it becomes extremely valuable.

Conclusion

This project gave me real hands-on experience with a professional static analysis tool. Scanning DVWA with SonarQube showed me how vulnerabilities are detected, how issues are categorized, and how developers use analysis tools to write more secure code.

It also strengthened my troubleshooting skills and gave me a deeper understanding of secure coding practices.
